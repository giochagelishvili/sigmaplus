# SIGMA +

This is a pivotal project for me and my team, representing our inaugural undertaking. Our efforts have been focused on documenting the skills we've acquired and the work we've accomplished through an XP system. 

This system enables us to level up based on the amount of time and effort we dedicate to our work. Specifically, we award 30XP for each hour of distraction-free work. 

We've organized our work into distinct sections on our website, allowing us to easily monitor our progress as we continue to develop our skills and pursue our goals.
